# Partial Least Squares Regression (PLS)
[sample code](./partial_least_squares_regression.py)  
`Partial Least Squares Regression` is similar to `Principal Components Regression`, in that regression is done on scores. The difference is that the responses y (Y) are used to find scores that have a large covariance between X and y (Y). One advantage of `Partial Least Squares Regression` over `Principal Components Regression` is that the number of required components is reduced.

To understand `Partial Least Squares Regression`, it would be nice to learn first:
