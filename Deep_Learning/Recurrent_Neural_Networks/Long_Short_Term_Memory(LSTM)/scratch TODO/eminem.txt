Look, if you had one shot, one opportunity 
To seize everything you ever wanted 
One moment 
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy 
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti 
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready 
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin' 
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud 
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out 
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now 
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity 
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked 
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No 
He won't have it, he knows his whole back city's ropes 
It don't matter, 
He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke 
He's so stacked that he knows 
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's 
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody 
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
The souls escaping, through this hole that it's gaping 
This world is mine for the taking 
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order 
A normal life is boring, but super stardom's close to post-mortem
It only grows harder, only grows hotter 
He blows us all over, these hoes is all on him 
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter 
Lonely roads, God only knows 
He's grown farther from home, he's no father 
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter 
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water 
His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product 
They moved on to the next schmo who flows 
He nose dove and sold nada 
So the soap opera is told and unfolds 
I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on 
Da da dumb da dumb da da
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
No more games, I'm a change what you call rage 
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged 
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed 
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage 
But I kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next cipher 
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper 
All the pain inside amplified by the fact 
That I can't get by with my nine to five 
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family 
'Cause man, these God damn food stamps don't buy diapers 
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life 
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder 
Tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus 
See dishonor caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna 
Baby mama drama screamin' on and Too much for me to want to Stay in one spot, 
another day of monotony Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail 
I've got to formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot 
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failures not 
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go 
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot 
So here I go is my shot. 
Feet fail me not 'cause maybe the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
You can do anything you set your mind to, man

May I have your attention please?
May I have your attention please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're going to have a problem here
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door
Started whoopin' her ass worse than before, they first get divorced
Throwing her over furniture
It's the return of the "Oh wait, no way, your kidding,
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr Dre said
Nothing you idiots Dr Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha)
Feminist women love Eminem, chicka chicka chicka Slim Shady I'm sick of him
Look at him, walking around grabbing his you know what
Flippin' the you know who "yeah, but he's so cute though"
Yea I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's going on in your parent's bedrooms
Sometimes I want to get on TV and just let loose, but can't,
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips
And if I'm lucky you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a women's clitoris is.
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is, by the time they hit 4th grade,
They got the discovery channel don't they?
We ain't nothing but mammals,
Well some of us cannibals, who cut other people open like cantaloupes.
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel I got the antidote.
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too.
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me.
"But Slim what if you win wouldn't it be weird?"
Why? So you guys can just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears.
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first.
Little bitch put me on blast on M-T-V
"Yeah he's cute but I think he's married to Kim, he he"
I should download her audio on mp3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem V.D.
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups all you do is annoy me
So I've been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me, who dress like me
Walk, talk and act like me, it just might be the next best thing,
But not quite me
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
I'm like a head trip to listen to
'Cause I'm only giving you, things you joke about with your friends
Inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugar coat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it, and whether you like to admit it (rip)
I just shit it better than 90 percent of you rappers out there
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums, it's funny
'Cause at the rate I'm going when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting.
Pinching nurses asses when I'm jackin' off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin' he could be workin' at Burger King
Spitten on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot circling,
Screaming I don't give a fuck with his windows down and system up
So will the real Shady, please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up
And to be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
Haha, I guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us,
Fuck it,
Let's all stand up
