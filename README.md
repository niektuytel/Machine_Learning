# Machine Learing (ML)
The perpose of this repo to get a easy understanding how to use `ML` with libraries.  
As well the way it works from scratch, so we know what is going on.

Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.  
Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

To start understanding all the Machine Learning algorithms,  
you must get the basic understanding
of `Calculus` and `Linear Algebra`.  
+ [`Linear Algebra`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=1)
+ [`Calculus`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr&index=1)

[`Supervised Learning`](./Supervised_Learning(SL))`, `
[`Unsupervised Learning `](./Unsupervised_Learning(UL))` and `
[`Reinforcement Learning`](./Reinforcement_Learning(RL))  
are subsets of `Machine Learning` that contains algorithms to use on specific tasks.  
`Deep Learning` is a subset of machine learning networks capable of learning  
unsupervised from data that is unstructured or unlabeled.  

The best step to get started is trough [`Deep Learning`](./Deep_Learning(DL)).  
The reason is that you will understand more the purpose of the algorithms  
and when to use different types of algorithms.  

When there is a clear understanding how  [`Deep Learning`](./Deep_Learning(DL)) is working nor used on data,  
[`Supervised Learning`](./Supervised_Learning(SL))`, `
[`Unsupervised Learning `](./Unsupervised_Learning(UL))` and `
[`Reinforcement Learning`](./Reinforcement_Learning(RL))  
are understandable as well.
