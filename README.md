# Machine Learing (ML)
`Machine learning` is an application of artificial intelligence (`AI`) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.
`Machine learning` focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.  

For beginners [`Machine Learning by Google`](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning) and [`Machine Learning by scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) will be a good take-off.  
To start understanding most of the `Machine Learning` algorithms, you must get the basic understanding of `Calculus` and `Linear Algebra`:  
+ [`Linear Algebra`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=1)
+ [`Calculus`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr&index=1)
+ [`Derivatives exersices`](http://derivative-functions.cours-de-math.eu/exercises-derivative-basic.php)  
+ [`Derivatives exersices`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yfh5cf4-0w)  
+ [`Partial Derivatives`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_di4Zn4wz4&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNPOjrT6KVlfJuKtYTftqH6&index=1)

When there is a clear understanding how  [`Deep Learning`](./deep_learning/README.md) is working nor used on data.  
[`Supervised Learning`](./supervised_learning/README.md)`, ` [`Unsupervised Learning `](./unsupervised_learning/README.md)` and ` [`Reinforcement Learning`](./reinforcement_learning/README.md) are understandable as well.

## Requirements 
```python
  # (required to have programming knowledge)
  # 1 - open a command prompt, in this folder.
  # 2 - paste line below & press enter.
  pip3 install -r "./requirements.txt"
```
## Subsets of `Machine Learning`:
+ [`Deep Learning`](./deep_learning/README.md)
+ [`Supervised Learning`](./supervised_learning/README.md)
+ [`UnSupervised Learning`](./unsupervised_learning/README.md)
+ [`Reinforcement Learning`](./reinforcement_learning/README.md)
