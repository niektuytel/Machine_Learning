# Machine Learing (ML)
`Machine learning` is an application of artificial intelligence (`AI`) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.
`Machine learning` focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.  

To start understanding most of the `Machine Learning` algorithms, you must get the basic understanding of `Calculus` and `Linear Algebra`.

When there is a clear understanding how  [`Deep Learning`](./deep_learning/README.md) is working nor used on data.  
[`Supervised Learning`](./supervised_learning/README.md)`, ` [`Unsupervised Learning `](./unsupervised_learning/README.md)` and ` [`Reinforcement Learning`](./reinforcement_learning/README.md) are understandable as well.

# Requirements 
```python
  # (required to have programming knowledge)
  # 1 - open a command prompt, in this folder.
  # 2 - paste line below & press enter.
  pip3 install -r "./requirements.txt"
```
